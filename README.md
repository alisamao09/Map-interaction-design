# Map-interaction-design
Designed and improved the interactive map showing water conditions for villages in China based on survey results for the villages

## Overview
As a NGO, MyH2O is commited to help undeveloped villages in China to improve water conditions. We firstly collected samples and surveys from the villages to get the water condition data, then we visualized the data in Tableau. Users can get a sense of water conditions and corresponding public policies by clicking on the village on the map. This can not only help the public to get a sense of water situation in the undeveloped villages in China, but also help policy makers to decide the policies to implement on villages. The initialization of the map (connect to the data source, filter/set data) was finished by other team members, and I was in charge of further improvements.

## Main process
* Applied shapes to water condition improvement methods for visual representation
* Designed and formatted the charts, and set up tool tips
* Arranged objects in containers 
* Designed the layout for the mobile app and the website
